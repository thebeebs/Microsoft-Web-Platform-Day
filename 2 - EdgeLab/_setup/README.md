Setting up your environment for the labs
========================================
In this lab you will find the prerequisites and steps to help you set up your computer. After completing the lab you will have a working environment ready for the other labs.

Configure your computer
-----------------------

### Install a development environment
These labs will use **Visual Studio** as the development environment for building and updating the cross-platform application presented as example.

If you want to follow the instructions to the letter you will need to install **Visual Studio 2015 Preview** on your computer. This preview can be downloaded and installed from [here](
http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/visual-studio-2015-downloads-vs.aspx).

Alternatively, you can use Visual Studio 2013 with Update 4 ([download](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs))  or any other development environment of your choice.

Visual Studio will also provide the functionality of serving the web application. In case you are not using Visual Studio the web application can be served by any other tool that you want to use, like Apache, IIS, Azure Websites, etc.

### Have at least 2 browsers installed
The labs will also make use of more than one browser for testing the web application provided as sample. In most cases it will be [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge), but in other cases another browser (e.g. [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)) will be used.

### Clone or download content of this GitHub repository (optional but recommended)

The labs provided have a combination of text documentation and sample code. In order to have all documentation and necessary sample files locally on your computer, we strongly recommend you clone (using [Git](http://git-scm.com/)) or download all content in this repository locally on your computer.

Summary
-------

You now have an environment ready for developing and testing the web application.
